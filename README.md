# Nand to Tetris 
Welcome to the Nand to Tetris course repository! Here you'll find a series of courses designed to take you on an exciting journey from understanding the fundamental building blocks of computer systems to constructing your own general-purpose computer capable of running programs like Tetris.

### Introduction ðŸ’»
In today's world, computers are ubiquitous, yet many of us lack a deep understanding of how they actually work. At Nand to Tetris, I believe that the best way to truly understand computers is to build one from scratch. This course offer a hands-on approach to learning, guiding anyone through the intricate web of hardware, software, and application systems.

**_Nand2Tetris covers the following key areas:_**

**_Hardware:-->_** From Boolean arithmetic to chip simulation and testing.   

**_Architecture:-->_** Including ALU/CPU design, addressing modes, and memory-mapped I/O.  

**_Low-level Languages:-->_** Design and implementation of machine language and assembly programming.  

**_Virtual Machines:-->_** Stack-based automata, function call handling, and VM language design.  

**_High-level Languages:-->_** Object-based language design and implementation.  

**_Compilers:-->_** Lexical analysis, parsing, code generation, and two-tier compilation.  

**_Programming:-->_** Implementation of assemblers, virtual machines, and compilers.  

**_Operating Systems:-->_** Design and implementation of memory management, input/output drivers, and more.  

**_Data Structures and Algorithms:-->_** Covering a range of fundamental data structures and algorithms.  

**_Software Engineering:-->_** Modular design, API design, unit testing, and quality assurance.
